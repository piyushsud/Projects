# Projects
This engineering portfolio contains some of the engineering projects I have worked on. 

The project which I am the most proud of is an FM radio receiver.

I have assembled the PCB and tested it at home - a short video is on my LinkedIn page. I've taken detailed notes on my design process, tradeoffs, part selection, and more in this repo: https://github.com/piyushsud/knowledge/tree/master

The design for each stage in the radio is a LaTex PDF under the respective folder for each stage, under knowledge/Project_Specific_Knowledge/public/fm_radio/stages. I've also put some less organized notes in the brain dump folder.  

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out at piyushsud@gmail.com!.
